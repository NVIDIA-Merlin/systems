# Release Notes for Merlin Systems

## Unreleased Changes

* I make a PR, I update the `docs/source/release_notes.md` file or I
  add a comment to the PR to describe why the change is not customer-facing.
  Certainly `chore` PRs can be excluded and maybe some `fix` PRs.

## v0.1.0

* Something happened. I just don't know what it was.
