# Project Title

Optional: Consider badges, <https://shields.io/>:

- Python version

- Build and test status

- Project version

- License

Required: Write a one to three sentence paragraph that identifies what the
project does and how the project solves an academic or business problem.

## Contents (Optional)

If you have more than 5 level-two headings and are so inclined, consider adding
a TOC.

## Installation (Required)

Specify prerequisites. Indicate which method is simplest or
preferred&mdash;ideally say why the method is preferred.

### Installing _project_ Using Conda

You can install _project_ with Anaconda from the `nvidia` channel:

```sh
conda install -c ...
```

If there is anything else to say or that is related to Conda, add it after the
code block.

### Installing _project_ Using Pip

You can install _project_ with `pip`:

```sh
pip install _project_
```

### Installing _project_ from Source

Refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md documentation for information about installing
_project_ from source.

### Running _project_ with Docker

NVIDIA provides _project_ in the Merlin containers that are available from the
container registry for NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC).

Add the standard table of container images here.

## Getting Started / First Steps / Using _project_ (Optional)

If you can show a short and runnable code sample that demonstrates how to use
the project, include it here and consider omitting the next heading.

```python
from myproject import SomeClass

SomeClass.doSomething()
```

If you cannot provide a short code sample that is runnable, consider providing a
code sample that highlights the most important classes and functions. However,
include comments in the code snippet to indicate that important code is omitted.
Adding notebooks or examples under the following heading becomes more important.

```python
import SomeClass as sc

# After data loading and preparation, use the whazzit function to...

x = SomeDataObject()

sc.whazzit(x)
```

## Notebook Examples and Tutorials (Optional)

Specify what is unique or helpful about the notebooks. Consider providing a link
to the examples directory.

Consider providing a bulleted list with the name of each notebook or a link to the directory for multi-notebook examples.

## Feedback and Support (Required)

Identify how customers report problems. Opening a GitHub issue seems likely.

Is there an NVIDIA community that might help?

I don't think we have a presence on public Slack instances, but throwing it out
there.

## License (Optional)

The heading is optional, but a license file in the repository is required.
